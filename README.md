# Chimera-in-multiplex-networks

This repo contains the python implementation of the paper : https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/S0218127416501200

A brief intro to the paper :
Chimera state is a symmetry breaking situation that appears in symmetrically coupled network of identical oscillators. in the above mentioned paper, authors have demonstrated the existence of chimera states in a multiplex networks, where there are two with 100 oscillators each and there is inter as well as intra layer coupling.

Unfortunate part is I am not able to replicate the results mentioned in the paper, and I will keep updating the repo.
